    This site supports the development release of a new (fourth) version of
    ``profess``. Not all features are complete.

    For now, some users would be better served by ``profess 3``, available
    `here <https://github.com/EACcodes/PROFESS>`_.


``profess`` is a high-performance engine for orbital-free density
functional theory (OFDFT). While the latest version was developed 
from scratch, it draws on the innovations powering earlier ``profess``
releases.

The ``profess`` code is predominantly modern C++, which is compiled
into a library in one of several parallelization modes. In addition,
Python bindings are provided for all essential commands. This structure
facilitates rapid scripting of common tasks, as well as frictionless
partnerships with complementary tools in the materials modelling
software ecosystem.

Seed funding for the latest version of ``profess`` was provided by The
Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) in the form of a software
fellowship carried out during Fall 2019.
